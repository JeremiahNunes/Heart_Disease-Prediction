## Heart_Disease-Prediction

The major challenge in heart disease is its detection. There are instruments available which can predict heart disease but either it are expensive or are not efficient to calculate chance of heart disease in human. Early detection of cardiac diseases can decrease the mortality rate and overall complications. However, it is not possible to monitor patients everyday in all cases accurately and consultation of a patient for 24 hours by a doctor is not available since it requires more sapience, time and expertise. Since we have a good amount of data in today’s world, we can use various machine learning algorithms to analyze the data for hidden patterns. The hidden patterns can be used for health diagnosis in medicinal data.

Machine Learning can play an essential role in predicting presence/absence of Locomotor disorders, Heart diseases and more. Such information, if predicted well in advance, can provide important insights to doctors who can then adapt their diagnosis and treatment per patient basis.
In this project , we worked on predicting potential Heart Diseases in people using Machine Learning algorithms. The algorithms included K Neighbors Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier. The dataset has been taken from Kaggle.
